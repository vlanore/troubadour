**Troubadour** is a simple framework to build python text-based games that:
* runs in the browser;
* runs entirely client-side so projects are easy to deploy;
* provides a simple object-based programming model;
* can save to browser storage and file out of the box;
* supports text formatting with colors and complex tooltips;
* provides complex input methods like forms and hex maps;
* provides side panels to display information.

Troubadour is currently in very early development.

Troubadour is built with [pyscript](https://pyscript.net/).
